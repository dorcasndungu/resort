<h1>Activities</h1>
<h5>Unlike most other island destinations, Magola Island has something to offer everyone.</h5>
<h5>Normal island activities available include a magical SPA, a well equipped watersports center and a selection of boat excursions.</h5>
<h2>Diving</h2>
<p>Daily one or two tank dive excursions go to a selection of dive sites both to the north and south of the island.</p>
<p>Shallow coral reefs dropping to depths of 30 meters abound with marine life and the added highlight of frequent Whale shark sightings from November to February make this a diverâ€™s paradise.</p>
<h2>Shopping</h2>
<p>Two small but well stocked boutiques offer a wide selection of clothing, souvenirs, African art, jewellery, swimwear and toiletries.</p>
<p>We also have local wood carvers at the beach who can produce customized carvings to order.</p>
